UNSW Thesis: Building an inexpensive UAV platform for agricultural use in small-scale applications

Radio controlled, remotely piloted aircraft popularity, particularly quad-rotor
aircraft use has dramatically increased within the last five years, due in part
to the decreasing cost and accessibility of consumer-grade 'drone' products.
Whilst these products have enabled a large market for consumer drone use in the
areas of photography and real estate due to their ability to be flown by
comparatively amateur pilots semi-autonomously, there exist many other potential
markets that could build on these established drone platforms and enable a
variety of civilian use cases for this new technology. The aim of this project
is to target the potential agricultural UAV market and build on existing freely
available open source hardware and software to design and manufacture an
appropriate, inexpensive UAV quad-rotor to fulfill a basic agricultural use
case. The UAV is to be utilized as a mobile data collection device to enable
crop monitoring of farmland that would otherwise be difficult to access via
land. The UAV is to be able to operate fully autonomously and perform the crop
monitoring task without the need for a skilled pilot or operator to be present.
Furthermore, the ground station software used to set the crop monitoring task is
designed to be highly user-friendly to allow the product to be accessible to
smaller-scale agricultural operations with minimal training required.
